# BokehPopGraphDemo

I was experimenting with what I learned from the DataCamp course "Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh"
Using a sample data set "gapminder_tidy.csv" originally from Gapminder.

To be interactive, the script need to be run using a bokeh server ('bokeh serve' method) as detailed in the script docstring.
